# PatternExtractor.jl

Julia code for extracting patterns from deep generative approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) using log-linear models as proposed in [Hess et al. 2020](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/20/5045/5869514). 
Jupyter Notebook showing basic functionality with single cell RNA-Seq data is available. Jupyter notebook tested on Julia version 1.72.
